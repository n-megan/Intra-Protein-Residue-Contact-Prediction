# Intra-Protein-Residue-Contact-Prediction
Final project for EN.605.652 - Biological Databases and Database Tools at JHU
The objective of this system is to store information about the residues of a protein and predict
residue-residue interactions by calculating residue contacts based on spatial distance.
Specifically, the contacts are determined by using the alpha-carbon atoms and beta-carbon
atoms of different residues (inter-residue contacts).
